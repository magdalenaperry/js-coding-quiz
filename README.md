## Description
This is a timed quiz I created using javascript, css, and html.

## Usage
When the app is deployed and the user clicks start and is presented with a series of questions. If the questions are answered correctly, the score is increased by 20 points, if the questions are answered incorrectly, the timer is decreased by 10 seconds.
